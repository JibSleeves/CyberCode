# **App Name**: Cyberpunk Coder

## Core Features:

- Cyberpunk Terminal UI: Integrate the Cyberpunk-2077 CSS theme to create a retro-futuristic terminal-like interface, focusing on neon colors and grid-based layouts. Mimic a vintage terminal with a header bar and a sidebar for file and model management.
- Ollama Agent: Leverage Ollama for local LLM inference, allowing users to select from available models programmatically. Use the AutoAgent framework to enable natural language triggers for code analysis and refactoring.
- Web RAG: Implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines to ingest external information. Use a tool to integrate web content using DuckDuckGo and LangChain for real-time knowledge augmentation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neon blue (#4D4DFF) to reflect the cyberpunk aesthetic.
- Secondary colors: Dark gray (#333333) for backgrounds and bright green (#00FF00) for text highlights.
- Accent: Electric purple (#800080) for interactive elements.
- Use monospaced fonts to mimic a retro terminal look.
- Employ glyph-style icons to maintain the terminal aesthetic.
- Implement a grid-based layout with clear divisions for the header, sidebar, code editor, and terminal output.
